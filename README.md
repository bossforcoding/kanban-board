# kanban_board
I realised a kanban board with React, a Javascript library, for a small university project. The kanban board has three main sections: TODO, IN_PROGESS, DONE. It allows the creation of new tasks divided into three categories:  TASK, BUG and USER STORY. Tasks can be filtered by title match or by category.
